## Last Updated
2026-05-10T09:30:00Z — Kudos / Recognition feature fully implemented end-to-end

## Current Status
The Kudos / Recognition feature is fully implemented end-to-end. The backend provides create, get, list (per-person and cross-person), and delete for kudos entries with date, Markdown text, and optional tags. The frontend includes TypeScript types, API client functions (5 functions), reusable components (KudosCard, KudosForm, KudosList), and an integrated "Kudos" tab on the person detail page with inline create form and delete. All 405 frontend tests and all backend tests pass.

## Known Issues / Bugs
| ID  | Description                                          | Severity | Status |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|
| 001 | Backend tests require Java 21 explicitly (system default may differ) | Low | Open |
| 002 | docker-compose.yml exposes db port 5432 (should only be in override) | Low | Open |
| 003 | FullStackIntegrationTest Property 14 (invalid morale status) has intermittent failure with edge-case strings | Low | Open |

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Quick Notes ("Inbox") — global capture, attach to person/1:1
2. Dashboard (upcoming 1:1s, overdue items, stale 1:1 alerts)
3. Sensitive content encryption (flag and encrypt private notes)
4. Notification scheduling (reminders for overdue items and upcoming 1:1s)
5. Search (full-text across all manager data)
6. Data export functionality (per-person Markdown)
7. Gamification elements (progress rings, streak counters, micro-animations)

## Architecture Decisions Made This Session
- Kudos are immutable after creation (create + delete only, no update) — recognition entries should not be edited after the fact
- Kudos stored as a flat table with userId + personId scoping — consistent with action items and PDP goals pattern
- Tags stored as PostgreSQL TEXT[] array — simple, queryable, no separate join table needed for MVP
- Sorted by date descending by default — most recent recognition shown first

## Environment / Setup Notes
- Java 21 is required for backend development (use SDKMAN: `sdk install java 21-tem`)
- Node.js 20+ required for frontend
- Docker required for running Testcontainers-based integration tests
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before running `./dev.sh backend`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for frontend-specific overrides
- The `next.config.mjs` is used instead of `next.config.ts` (Next.js 14.x doesn't support TS config)
- JetBrains Mono font loaded via Google Fonts CDN alongside Inter

## Test Coverage Summary

  - 1 pre-existing intermittent failure (Property 14 edge case)
- Frontend: 405 total — component tests (including Kudos components), page tests (including auth pages, Kudos tab), API client tests (including kudos) (last run: 2026-05-10)

  - Includes Kudos API client tests (14)
  - Includes PDP goal components (PdpGoalCard 18, PdpGoalForm 8, PdpGoalList 9, PdpGoalStatusBadge 4)
  - Includes PDP goal API client tests (19)
  - Includes PDP Goals tab integration tests (10)
  - Includes action item components (ActionItemCard 14, ActionItemForm 8, ActionItemList 9, ActionItemStatusBadge 3)
  - Includes action item API client tests (15)
  - Includes 1:1 components (timeline, entry editor, series config, Markdown editor, agenda items, sensitive toggle)
  - Includes Navigation component tests (8 tests)
  - Includes ThemeTokens design system tests (13 tests)
- E2E: No tests yet (Playwright configured)

## Open Questions / Flags for Human Review
- Property 14 test (invalid morale status) has an intermittent failure with certain generated strings — may need tighter string filtering or a different approach to testing invalid enum values
- Light mode toggle not yet implemented — currently dark-only. Should this be added as a user preference?
